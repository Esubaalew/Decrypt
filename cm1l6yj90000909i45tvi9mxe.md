When I was in high school, my plan was to join university in tech-related fields, score good marks for good grades, and get hired fast. However, when I began my university journey in Addis Ababa University to attend information systems, I quickly realized that my grades weren’t the only factor that mattered in getting a job after graduation. While good grades are important, so too are skills and experience in the field you want to work in.

Unfortunately, I learned that most students in my academic program only care about their grades, not their skills. They study hard as the day of the exam approaches and get good marks and thus good grades. However, as an IS student, no skill or programming knowledge is acquired, only a list of A, A+ and A-. Most teachers in the IS department don’t care about whether students copied a previously submitted project or not. They give good marks to those who copied others’ works and almost zero marks to those who do their projects themselves. Teachers discourage students who do their projects on their own, but encourage those who copy from others.

This is a common problem in many academic programs, where grades are often seen as the sole indicator of success, rather than the acquisition of valuable skills and experience. However, in many cases, the ability to demonstrate practical skills and real-world experience can be just as important, if not more so, when it comes to securing a job or advancing in your career.

It’s important to recognize that grades are not the only factor that will determine your success in your chosen career field. While good grades can certainly open doors and provide opportunities, they are not a guarantee of success. In order to truly excel, you must also be able to demonstrate practical skills and experience, as well as a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn and grow.

If you find that your program is not adequately preparing you for the workforce, it may be worthwhile to seek out additional training and experience on your own. Consider taking on internships or volunteer opportunities that allow you to gain hands-on experience in your field, or seek out online courses and certifications that can help you build your skills and knowledge.

Ultimately, it’s up to you to take ownership of your education and career path. Don’t be discouraged by the shortcomings of your academic program; instead, focus on developing your skills and experience in whatever ways you can. With determination, hard work, and a commitment to growth, you can succeed in your chosen field, regardless of your grades.
