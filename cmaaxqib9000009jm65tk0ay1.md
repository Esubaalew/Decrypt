Encountering the dreaded:

```plaintext
DEBUG: Failed to detach "usblp" module from <vendor>:<product>
```

When running CUPS‚Äôs USB backend, it can block all USB printing on modern Linux distributions. In this post, we‚Äôll explore why the `usblp` kernel module causes conflicts, and then walk through a bullet-proof, step-by-step solution‚Äîincluding blacklisting, initramfs updates, and daemon removals‚Äîthat permanently resolves the error and restores seamless USB printing via CUPS.

## üîç Understanding the Error

When you invoke the USB backend (`/usr/lib/cups/backend/usb`), CUPS attempts to detach the legacy `usblp` driver to claim the device via libusb instead. If `usblp` it remains bound‚Äîeither because it reloaded from initramfs or was re-bound by another service‚ÄîCUPS will log that detach failure and skip the device.

Blacklisting alone (`blacklist usblp`) is often insufficient, because modprobe may ignore blacklists without the ‚Äú-b‚Äù flag, and an old copy in initramfs can reload a module on boot. Additionally, userspace daemons like `ipp-usb` their snap equivalent can re-bind USB printers ahead of CUPS and masquerade as, perpetuating the conflict.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1\. Repair Your Package Manager

First, ensure APT/Dpkg is in a clean state so you can remove conflicting packages:

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update
```

This completes any interrupted installations and refreshes package metadata.

### 2\. Block the `usblp` Kernel Module

Simply blacklisting may still allow indirect loads. Use both **blacklist** and **install ‚Ä¶ /bin/false** directives:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-usblp.conf <<EOF
blacklist usblp
install usblp /bin/false
EOF
```

This forces modprobe to refuse loading `usblp` under any circumstances.

### 3\. Rebuild Initramfs and Reboot

A stale initramfs often contains an older modprobe configuration. Update it so your new blacklist is honored:

```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, confirm the module is not loaded:

```bash
lsmod | grep usblp
```

No output indicates success.

### 4\. Remove or Disable Conflicting USB/IPP Services

Daemonized IPP-over-USB services can rebind printers before CUPS‚Äôs backend runs. Purge or disable them:

```bash
sudo apt purge ipp-usb
sudo snap remove cups      # if you had a snap-based CUPS
sudo systemctl mask ipp-usb.service
```

This prevents any userspace reattachment of the device.

### 5\. Validate the Fix in CUPS

Unload any stray module, then run the USB backend in debug mode:

```bash
sudo modprobe -r usblp
sudo /usr/lib/cups/backend/usb
```

Your printer(s) should list without any ‚ÄúFailed to detach‚Äù messages. Finally, check CUPS logs for errors:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u cups -e
```

## üéØ Conclusion

By thoroughly blacklisting and blocking the `usblp` module, rebuilding initramfs, and removing IPP-over-USB daemons, you ensure that CUPS‚Äôs USB backend can reliably claim your printer via libusb‚Äîeliminating the ‚ÄúFailed to detach `usblp`‚Äù error once and for all. Enjoy hassle-free USB printing under CUPS!
